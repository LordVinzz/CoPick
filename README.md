# CoPick

This project is used to quickly test and visualize text contrast against a background color.

It allows selecting a background color and automatically generates a readable text color based on a chosen contrast ratio.

The tool is intended for fast readability checks, color selection in interfaces, and quick contrast experiments without relying on external tools or libraries.
